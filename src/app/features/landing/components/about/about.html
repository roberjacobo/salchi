          <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg">
            Dachshunds originated in Germany over 300 years ago. Their name literally means "badger dog" in German,
            as they were originally bred to hunt badgers and other burrow-dwelling animals. Their distinctive long,
            low bodies were perfect for going underground.
